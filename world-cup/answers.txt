Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
No predictions which were proved incorrect

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
1,000 results would probably give a sufficient result and going higher than this
would seem to be less worth the diminishing results with increased times.
