The listener's aura best fits into the
"Purple" category. The valence is average
while both the energy and danceability are
above average implying a more "passionate"
listener.

This is not a particularly suitable way of
finding a musical aura due to the averages
made - for example the listener might fit
into two very distinct auras, one where they
listen to very low valence music and one
very high valence but, because this is
averaged, this isn't reflected in the
results.

One better way to find auras would be to
group songs together based on a listening
session so as not to average distinct music
auras. Another way to see whether the
listener varies from extreme to extreme
would be to take a root mean square value.
